\noindent Apart from the combined effort of us four, this project wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance and support of our Project Guide Prof. Milind Fernandes. We are grateful to you Sir.

\noindent We take this opportunity to thank Mr Valindo Godinho, CTO of Wafer OÜ, a start-up currently situated in Panaji. He helped us with the initial design and working of our Windows App ‘TRACE’. He always made himself available to solve any queries and bugs in the code that we encountered.

\noindent We would also like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. H. G. Virani, The Head of Department and the entire staff of Electronics and Telecommunication Department for providing all the required help and facilities needed for the completion of the project.
One of the senior faculty members always stayed back late to lock up the Department when we needed to work afterhours and we are really grateful for that. 

\noindent Lastly, we would like to thank all our classmates who voluntarily helped us build the gait database.
